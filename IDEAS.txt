- build option groups (for more structured output display)

- build options should be typed?

- maybe the top-level extension buildInfra should be itself extensible and provide
setup for other parts of the env configuration? For example, with the testing plugin:

buildInfra {
  testing {
    includeTestTasks = [".*:test"]
  }
}

If a sub-plugin is not enabled, it'd error out because these extensions would be added
dynamically.

- add tests, perhaps as a separate project so that the build-infra can be used independently
as a submodule?
